  The running script must provide the following information as it runs:

 .  What is being checked/installed.

 .  What the outcome of a test for changes is.

 .  Whether there are any errors or no.

  With this in mind, an approach is to mark each line with a special symbol,
  as follows:

 .  '>-- <x>'       Starting in on <x>.

 .  '<-- <x>'       Done with <x> having done nothing directly (<x> was an
                    aggregate).

 .  '->- <msg>'     Starting check.

 .  '-<- <x>'       Done with check and done with <x>.

 .  '--> <msg>'     Check failed, starting install.

 .  '--< <x>'       Done with install and done with <x>.

 .  '!-- <msg>'     Failure while doing nothing.

 .  '-!- <msg>'     Failure during check.

 .  '--! <msg>'     Failure during installation.

 .  '!!! <msg>'     Abort was signalled by controlling application.

 .  '--- <msg>'     Skip was signalled by controlling application.

 .  '*** <msg>'     Informational message.
