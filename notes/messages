  The running script must provide the following information as it runs:

 .  What is being checked/installed.

 .  What the outcome of a test for changes is.

 .  Whether there are any errors or no.

  With this in mind, an approach is to mark each line with a special symbol,
  as follows:

 .  '>>> <x>'       Starting in on <x>.

 .  '<<< <x>'       Done with <x>.

 .  '*** <msg>'     Starting check.

 .  '@@@ <msg>'     Check failed, starting install.

 .  '??? <msg>'     Warning message.

 .  '!!! <msg>'     Failure.

 .  '### <msg>'     Informational message.

 .  '~~~ <msg>'     Abort was signalled by controlling application.

 .  '--- <msg>'     Skip was signalled by controlling application.
