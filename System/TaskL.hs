{-| The Task\\L system provides a language for configuring Linux machines (and
    it probably works on other UNIX-alikes, provided the GNU core-utils are
    installed).

    Tasks in Task\\L are idempotent by design; one may build up packages of
    idempotent actions from a library of primitive commands that each resemble
    a classic UNIX command (see the @IdemShell@ docs to find out more about
    these commands).

    The input to the Task\\L system is a list of 'Tree' of 'Task' items,
    specifying operations and their dependencies. Multiple declarations of the
    same task are merged and contradictions checked for before the whole
    structure is flattened into a linear schedule in which each attribute -- a
    file's permissions, a group's membership list -- is touched but one time.

    The schedule is compiled to a Bash script which may then be executed to
    instantiate the configuration. As it runs, the script gives notes which
    package (or packages) it is operating on as well any subtasks; the script
    may be run in an interactive mode that allows delaying, skipping or
    aborting at any step.

{-| A task may be either a command or a named package. Commands provide their
    own labels. Every 'Task' may attach tests to restrict the circumstances
    under which a command is run.

{-| The script backend consumes a schedule, a list of basic operations, which
    is constructed from a forest of 'Task' nodes. The forest encodes
    dependencies among tasks.

    The forest is first translated to a forest in which every task is labelled
    with its position in the forest, giving a notion of the desired ordering.
    The forest is then collapsed to a list in which like tasks are merged and
    paired with their collective dependents. At this stage, contradictions are
    detected; unmergeable operations result in an error.

    The commands are then scheduled according to these guidelines:

   *  Dependencies must come before their dependents.

   *  It would be nice if tasks that were earlier in the input came before
      commands that came later in the input.

   *  Commands with multiple dependents should be grouped so that each
      dependent is being run for as short a time as is practical.
