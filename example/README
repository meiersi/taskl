Generating the shell scripts:

 :; dist/build/taskl/taskl //web < example/servers.yaml > example/web.bash
 :; dist/build/taskl/taskl //db  < example/servers.yaml > example/db.bash

Using them to configure an Ubuntu Cloud Guest:

 :; ssh le-server.aws.com sudo bash < example/web.bash

Some things to notice about the generated scripts:

  * A call to update the repo cache is specified for every PPA, but scheduled
    only once; Task/L schedules one ARGV one time.

  * In pg.root and pg.branch, the client libs are installed with Aptitude but
    Task/L doesn't notice that they both request this because the two calls to
    Aptitude are not syntactically alike. Thus it always tries to install
    client libs twice.

  * A bland smiley face is shown for each named task (//web, //db, &c.) when
    it succeeds but there is no failure message. (This might change for it
    might be that the many error messages provided by command line tools prove
    to be sufficient.)
