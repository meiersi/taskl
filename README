Task/L is a principled approach to describing, sharing and composing system
configurations.

  * Task/L input files are YAML or JSON: configurations are data, easy to
    generate and easy to introspect.

  * Task/L tasks can reference tasks in other files or at HTTP URLs,
    simplifying modularization and sharing.

  * The basic building blocks of Task/L are Bash fragments and arrays of
    commands, so it's easy to extend (and in the latter format, free of
    escaping headaches).

  * Commands can be URLs, too; these are downloaded and run.

  * Task/L generates a Bash script for applying a configuration. There is no
    runtime, no agent, no bootstrapping.
