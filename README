SYNOPSIS
       taskl //<task> <arg>* < <taskl.yaml>
       taskl (-v | --version)
       taskl (-h | --help)

DESCRIPTION
       Task/L  compiles  a  system configuration, described in YAML, to a Bash
       script which can be used to instantiate the configuartion.

       The YAML files describes tasks which have a body  and  dependencies  on
       other  tasks. Tasks can accept arguments, which are templated in to the
       commands that make up the body and can be passed on  to  the  dependen-
       cies.

       The  body of a Task/L task is a list commands, where each command is an
       array of strings (without any of the usual shell  escaping  headaches).
       If the headword of the command is an HTTP or HTTPS URL, then the target
       of the URL will be downloaded, marked executable and run with the given
       arguments at run time.

DEPENDENCIES
       Scripts generated by taskl rely on bash and curl.

APPLICATION
       taskl //nginx < example/servers.yaml | ssh user@host.com sudo bash

       The  generated scripts can be given arguments to run specific task bod-
       ies (for debugging), to show the plan and to  show  the  subtasks  that
       were compiled in.
